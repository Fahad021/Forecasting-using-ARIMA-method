## Project outline
- The objective of the project is to forecast the order demand using AUTOREGRESSIVE INTEGRATED MOVING AVERAGE model for 4 warehouses respectively.
- For this analysis we have downloaded the data from Kaggle. (https://www.kaggle.com/felixzhao/productdemandforecasting/data)
- The basics of ACF, PACF, rolling mean average, rolling standard deviation and correlogram are explained in this documentation.
- By the end of the documentation you'll have a clear idea about **A**utoregressive **I**ntegrated **M**oving **A**verage or **ARIMA** model, data visualization, data analysis, statistical library functions in python and creation of interactive plots using plotly.

## What makes the dataset intersting
- The dataset contains historical product demand for a manufacturing company with footprints globally. 
- The company provides thousands of products within dozens of product categories for 7 years. There are four central warehouses to ship products within the region it is responsible for.
- The data is available in the .csv format which allows us to perform the dataframe operations easily.

## 5 Steps towards Forecasting

## Introduction to ARIMA

- ARIMA is a forecasting technique. ARIMAâ€“ Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average the key tool in Time Series Analysis.
- Models that relate the present value of a series to past values and past prediction errors - these are called ARIMA models.
- ARIMA models provide an approach to time series forecasting. 
- ARIMA is a forecasting technique that projects the future values of a series based entirely on its own inertia.
- Exponential smoothing and ARIMA models are the two most widely-used approaches to time series forecasting. 
- Exponential smoothing models are based on a description of trend and seasonality in the data, ARIMA models aim to describe the autocorrelations in the data.
- Its main application is in the area of short term forecasting requiring at least 40 historical data points. 
- It works best when your data exhibits a stable or consistent pattern over time with a minimum amount of outliers.
- ARIMA is usually superior to exponential smoothing techniques when the data is reasonably long and the correlation between past observations is stable.

### Code summary

- The flow of the program is excuted in 2 ways.
- One is as per the flow chart and the alternative one is by using Auto Arima algorithm which is pre-installed package in Anaconda Python.
- The uploaded code is excuted in the Jupyter environment. 
- Kindly as mentioned above install the packages required to run the program.

### Packages to import in Python before running the program

```
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import plotly.plotly as py
import plotly.graph_objs as go
from plotly.offline import download_plotlyjs, init_notebook_mode,  plot
from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import adfuller
import numpy as np
import math
from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import acf, pacf
from statsmodels.tsa.arima_model import ARIMA
import warnings
import itertools
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import statsmodels.api as sm
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.pylab as pylab
```
- To set the figure size for all the plots together you can use the following code

```
params = {'legend.fontsize': 'xx-large',
          'figure.figsize': (15, 10),
         'axes.labelsize': 'xx-large',
         'axes.titlesize':'xx-large',
         'xtick.labelsize':'xx-large',
         'ytick.labelsize':'xx-large'}

pylab.rcParams.update(params)
```
- To perform time series operations easily we are changing the normal date format from the csv file to Pandas Datestamp.

```
DataFrame=pd.read_csv('Historical Product Demand.csv')
DataFrame['Pandas_Datestamp'] = pd.to_datetime(DataFrame['Date'], infer_datetime_format=True)
DataFrame['Year'] = pd.DatetimeIndex(DataFrame['Date']).year
DataFrame['Month'] = pd.DatetimeIndex(DataFrame['Date']).month
DataFrame.sort_values(by='Pandas_Datestamp')
```
- In the Pandas world 'obj' data type is nothing but string. This is one of the challenges we faced. `pd.to_numeric` is the command used to change the column of dataframe to numeric type where we could perform mathematical operations.

```
#CHANGING STRING TO NUMERIC
DataFrame.Order_Demand = pd.to_numeric(DataFrame['Order_Demand'], errors='coerce')
```
### Data visualization

- The below code runs in a `for` loop where for all the 4 warehouse the graphs are plotted using plotly interactive plots.
- This is one of the easy way to use the facility of `sub plots` provided by the plotly. 
- **Only the snippet of code is given. Kindly refer .ipynb file or .py file for elaborate explanation** 

```
from plotly import tools
import plotly.plotly as py
import plotly.graph_objs as go
for i in range(0, len(Warehouse)):
    WH_S=pd.DataFrame(DataFrame[DataFrame['Warehouse']== Warehouse[i]])
    WH_S_2012=WH_S[WH_S['Year']==2012]
    WH_S_2012=pd.DataFrame(WH_S.groupby('Product_Category', as_index=False)['Order_Demand'].mean())
    WH_S_2012= WH_S_2012.sort_values('Order_Demand', ascending=False)
    trace1 = go.Bar(x=WH_S_2012['Product_Category'],  y=WH_S_2012['Order_Demand'], name='Year_2012')
    trace2 = go.Bar(x=WH_S_2013['Product_Category'],  y=WH_S_2013['Order_Demand'], name='Year_2013')
    trace3 = go.Bar(x=WH_S_2014['Product_Category'],  y=WH_S_2014['Order_Demand'], name='Year_2014')
    fig = tools.make_subplots(rows=2, cols=5)
    fig.append_trace(trace3, 1, 3)
    fig.append_trace(trace2, 1, 4)
    fig.append_trace(trace1, 1, 5)
    fig['layout'].update(height=500, width=1200, title='Order demand vs product category with respect to all years for '+ str (Warehouse[i]),xaxis=dict(
        title='Product Category',
        titlefont=dict(
            family='Courier New, monospace',
            size=18,
            color='#7f7f7f'
        )
    ),
    yaxis=dict(
        title='Order Demand',
        titlefont=dict(
            family='Courier New, monospace',
            size=18,
            color='#7f7f7f')))
    py.iplot(fig, filename='stacked-subplots', layout=layout)
    plot(fig, filename='stacked-subplots')
  ```

## References
*In this section, provide links to your references and data sources.  For example:*
- Source code was adapted from [the magic source code farm](http://www.amagicalnonexistentplace.com)
- The code retrieves data from [the organization for hosting cool data](http://www.anothermagicalnonexistentplace.com)
- The forecasting models were modified from [some academic research paper](http://www.linktotheacademicpaperyouused.com)


## Explanation of the Code
*In this section you should provide a more detailed explanation of what, exactly, your Python script(s) actually do.  Your classmates should be able to read your explanation and understand what is happening in the code.*

The code, `needs_a_good_name.py`, begins by importing necessary Python packages:
```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

- *NOTE:  If a package does not come pre-installed with Anaconda, you'll need to provide instructions for installing that package here.*

We then import data from [insert name of data source].  We print the data to allow us to verify what we've imported:
```
x = [1, 3, 4, 7]
y = [2, 5, 1, 6]

for i in range(0,len(x)):
	print "x[%d] = %f" % (i, x[i])		
```
- *NOTE 1:  This sample code doesn't actually import anything.  You'll need your code to grab live data from an online source.*  
- *NOTE 2:  You will probably also need to clean/filter/re-structure the raw data.  Be sure to include that step.*

Finally, we visualize the data.  We save our plot as a `.png` image:
```
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.savefig('samplefigure.png')	
plt.show()
```

The output from this code is shown below:

## How to Run the Code
*Provide step-by-step instructions for running the code.  For example, I like to run code from the terminal:*
1. Ensure that you have registered for the [insert name of API] API key.  (You may reference the instructions for doing this.)

2. Ensure that you have installed necessary Python packages. (Again, you may include a reference here to a prior section in the README that provides the instructions.)


2. Open a terminal window.

2. Change directories to where `needs_a_good_name.py` is saved.

3. Type the following command:
	```
	python needs_a_good_name.py
	```

- *NOTE: You are welcome to provide instructions using Anaconda, IPython, or Jupyter notebooks.*
